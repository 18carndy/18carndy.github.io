title: CYOA Reflection
---
<h1>Describe one challenge you encountered and how you overcame it.</h1>
<p>A challenge I was faced with pretty early on was that of my own ambition. In my mind I had this grand adventure where there would be character progression, riveting and dangerous quests and so on. Yet time was against me and I was never able to fully realize those ambitions.</p>
<h2>Describe one element of your game you are proud of and why.</h2>
<p>I'm most proud of the amount of content I was able to get down on "paper", despite the time limit. I also think the writing is fairly decent.</p>
<h3>Describe at least one idea for how you could extend your game in the future.</h3>
<p>Just continuing the story line would be the best way to continue the game along. In other words, more raiding, more fight scenes, possible rivalry, etc.</p>
