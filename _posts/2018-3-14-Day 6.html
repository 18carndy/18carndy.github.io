Day 6: Still looking for clean water. The clacking from the daywalkers grow closer each day. The barricades should hold them off, for now. Each day brings more problems. Rats have infested the larder. Luke grows paler and his strength is slowly waning. I hope he gets better or else I might have to make him leave. If anyone reads this, please, send help. - Swede
